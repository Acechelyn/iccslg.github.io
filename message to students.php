							<p>Dear <strong>ICC Students</strong>,</p><br>
							<p>Greetings in Christ!</p><br>
							<p>One of the greatest challenges that teachers, administrators and personnel of Imus Computer College have to face today, is the molding of our youth who will become the foundation of our nation’s future.</p>
							<p>In our pursuit for academic excellence, we aspire to deliver you not only the latest in Information Technology but also to equip you with the right SKILLS, right ATTITUDE, and DISCIPLINE to help you become globally-competitive and goal-oriented individuals. But we cannot do these without your help. We cannot help improve your lives without your cooperation. This message aims to inspire you—our humble beginnings would teach you PATIENCE and PERSEVERANCE in achieving your goals; our philosophy and mission would teach you TO REACH OUT; and our school regulations would instill in You SELF-DISCIPLINE to become morally upright and be able to discern what is right from wrong. Thus, at every semester and by the end of each school year; we endeavor to help bring about the best that YOU can become.</p><br>
							<p style="text-align: center;">
								<strong>WELCOME TO YOUR SECOND HOME and GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS</strong></p><br>
							<p><strong>Emmanuel P. Del Prado</strong><br>
								<em>President and Founder</em>
