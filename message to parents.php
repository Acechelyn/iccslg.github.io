							<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p><br>
							<p>Greetings in Christ!</p><br>
							<p>We at ICC believe that the success of our students are greatly dependent on the team effort of parents/guardians-teachers. We encourage our students to help better themselves by providing the best possible quality computer education around while giving value for your money. While it is true that most computer schools charge very high tuition fees nowadays, ICC’s tuition charges remain to be unbeatable in terms of its affordability while delivering quality education for our students. We believe that quality computer education need not be expensive. We believe that the skills we will transfer to your sons and daughters will become their assets in improving their lives as they graduate and face the real world outside the four corners of our classrooms.</p>
							<p>We thank you for entrusting us the education of your sons and daughters.</p><br>
							<p>May we continue to have a rewarding educational partnership for your son/daughter’s future.</p><br>
							<p><strong>Emmanuel P. Del Prado</strong><br>
								<em>President and Founder</em>
